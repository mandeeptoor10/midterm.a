                <h1> The Vaccine Debate</h1>
                <h2> covid debates  
                 </h2>
                 <p>The whole world is facing is many problems due to the covid 19 pandemic. This pandemic arises many debates in people. Many people want to live their life with freedom.whereas, Others donâ€™t follow the suit and opine that lockdown is protecting us from covid  </p>
                <br> 
                 <p2>A cluster of like-minded people believes that there is no need to quaritine at home because the majority of the population has been vaccinated, which means people can live their normal lives again. A prime illustration of the U.K, where no need to wear a mask, people can gather in the park and other public places. They say that pandemic has been over, the government should relieve the restrictions.  </p2>
                <br>
                 <p3>Furthermore, many people opine that economy is falling due to lockdown, which means many people have lost their jobs. As such example of survey of  nw times which show that which shows that this is biggest fall in world gdp after 2008                         </p3>

                 <p>
                     On the other hand, people think that lockdown is good for us because it is protecting us from covid.
         There are millions of people all over the world who lost their lives due to covid we need to protect ourselves. Therefore, Lockdown should be going longer as much as possible or till 3rd dose of vaccinating.
         Whenever they should go outside, they have to wear a mask.. Finally, they say that this is the biggest step is has been taken by the government to protect people.
         
                 </p>
                 <br>
                 <p>
                     Overall, it can be seen that people are about lockdown and vaccines, creating a considerable debate. However, I personally opine that people should wear mask and follow the restriction that has been slapped by the government. But if people have been vaccinated with booster dose (3rd dose),they need not be wear mask.
